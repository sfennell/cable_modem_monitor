## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11 or 3.12
- Home Assistant development environment
- Git

### Local Development

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kwschulz/cable_modem_monitor.git
   cd cable_modem_monitor
   ```

2. **Install test dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r tests/requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run tests**
   ```bash
   pytest tests/ -v
   ```

4. **Deploy to your Home Assistant instance**
   ```bash
   # Edit deploy_to_ha.sh with your settings
   ./deploy_to_ha.sh
   ```

## Adding Support for New Modem Models

If you have a modem model that isn't currently supported:

1. **Capture HTML from your modem**
   ```bash
   curl -u username:password http://MODEM_IP/status_page.html > tests/fixtures/brand_model.html
   ```

2. **Create tests** for the new HTML structure in `tests/test_modem_scraper.py`

3. **Update scraper** in `custom_components/cable_modem_monitor/modem_scraper.py`

4. **Verify** both old and new modems work:
   ```bash
   pytest tests/ -v
   ```

5. **Submit a pull request** with:
   - Test fixtures (sanitize any personal info)
   - Test cases
   - Scraper updates
   - Documentation of supported modem model

## Code Style

- Follow [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/) style guidelines
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Add docstrings to functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and small
- Use async/await for I/O operations

### Linting
```bash
ruff check custom_components/cable_modem_monitor/
```

## Testing

All code changes should include appropriate tests:

### Running Tests
```bash
# All tests
pytest tests/ -v

# With coverage
pytest tests/ --cov=custom_components/cable_modem_monitor --cov-report=html

# Specific test
pytest tests/test_modem_scraper.py::TestModemScraper::test_parse_downstream_channels -v
```

### Test Requirements
- Unit tests for new parsing functions
- Integration tests for complete workflows
- Fixtures for new HTML structures
- Validation of data ranges and types

See [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) for comprehensive testing documentation.
